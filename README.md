# RSA ID Number Generator ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦

This project generates random South African ID numbers using the Luhn algorithm for validation. It is built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, providing a fast and modern development experience.

## Features

- Generates valid RSA ID numbers
- Uses the Luhn algorithm for checksum validation
- Built with React + TypeScript + Vite for rapid development
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for efficient development workflow

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
  ```bash
  npm i
  ```

2. **Run the development server:**
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

3. **Build for production:**
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

## How It Works

The generator creates a random RSA ID number and applies the Luhn algorithm to ensure the ID is valid according to South African standards.
